# Railway Frontend Build Fix

## Quick Solution for Railway Deployment

The frontend is failing to build on Railway. Here's the fix:

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Simplify the build in Railway dashboard:**
   - Go to your frontend project settings
   - Change build command to: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Change start command to: `npm start`

2. **Set environment variables in Railway:**
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-url.railway.app/api
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

### Option 2: Debug the Build

Check Railway logs for the exact error during `npm ci` or `npm run build`. The logs you showed only go up to the file copy stage.

### Option 3: Alternative Build Command

Try changing your Railway build settings to:
- Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`

### Most Common Railway Frontend Issues:

1. **TypeScript errors** - Fixed by removing `tsc &&` from build
2. **Missing dependencies** - Fixed by simplifying package.json  
3. **Path resolution** - Fixed by using relative imports
4. **Environment variables** - Need VITE_API_URL set

### Quick Test:
Can you see the full build error logs in Railway dashboard? The logs you shared stop at the file copy stage, but the actual error is likely during `npm ci` or `npm run build`.
